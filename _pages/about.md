My research interests span defining the technologies of future, artificial intelligence powered, healthcare applications. More specifically, I work on surgical vision and perception, and medical image computing, and my background is in computer vision. Lately, I have expanded my research interests in surgical data science and context-awareness in operating theaters.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Gazi University, Computer Engineering department. I received my MS and PhD from [State University of New York at Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) under supervision of [Prof. Jason J. Corso](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/), and my BS from [TOBB University of Economics and Technology](https://www.etu.edu.tr/tr/bolum/bilgisayar-muhendisligi). I am a [FULBRIGHT](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) alumna. I was formerly a Post-doctoral Researcher at [MediCIS, INSERM, Universite de Rennes 1](https://medicis.univ-rennes1.fr/) working on [Connected Optimized Network & Data in Operating Rooms Project](https://condor-project.eu/) with multiple academic and industrial partners, funded by [BPI France](https://www.bpifrance.com/), a Project Coordinator / Researcher at [ATLAS Program, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.roswellpark.org/education/professional-training/atlas-program) working in close collaboration with clinicians on Deep Blue Project, funded by the [Roswell Alliance Foundation](https://www.roswellpark.org/giving/why-give/about-foundation), and a Research Assistant at Vision and Perceptual Machines Lab at State University of New York at Buffalo on a [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) project in collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. 

I organized the First and Second International Workshops on [Context-Aware Operating Theaters](https://or20.univ-rennes1.fr/) in conjunction with MICCAI’18 in Granada, Spain and MICCAI’19 in Shenzhen, China I co-organized the second International [Surgical Data Science Workshop](http://workshop2019.surgical-data-science.org/) in conjunction with CARS’19 in Rennes, France and the [Joint 14th AE-CAI, 7th CARE and 3rd OR 2.0 Workshop](https://workshops.ap-lab.ca/aecai2020/) in conjunction with MICCAI'20 in Lima, Peru (virtual).

[The joint 15th AE-CAI, 8th CARE and 4th OR 2.0 Workshop](https://workshops.ap-lab.ca/aecai2021/) will take place in Strasbourg, France in 2021!

Currently, I am a board member of [Women in MICCAI](http://www.miccai.org/about-miccai/women-in-miccai/), and formerly was a member of the [Student Board](http://www.miccai.org/about-miccai/student-board/) and the [Educational Initiative](http://www.miccai.org/education/) at MICCAI.
