My research interests span defining the technologies of future, artificial intelligence powered, healthcare applications. More specifically, I work on surgical vision and perception, and medical image computing, and my background is in computer vision. Lately, I have expanded my research interests in surgical data science and context-awareness in operating theaters.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Gazi University, Computer Engineering department. I received my MS and PhD from State University of New York at Buffalo under supervision of Prof. Jason J. Corso, and my BS from TOBB University of Economics and Technology. I was formerly a Post-doctoral Researcher at Universite de Rennes 1 working on Connected Optimized Network & Data in Operating Rooms Project with multiple academic and industrial partners, funded by BPI France, a Project Coordinator / Researcher at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center working in close collaboration with clinicians on Deep Blue Project, funded by the Roswell Alliance Foundation, and a Research Assistant at Vision and Perceptual Machines Lab at State University of New York at Buffalo on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) project in collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. I am a FULBRIGHT alumna.

I organized the First and Second International Workshops on Context-Aware Operating Theaters in conjunction with MICCAI’18 in Granada, Spain and MICCAI’19 in Shenzhen, China ->https://or20.univ-rennes1.fr/, co-organized the second International Surgical Data Science Workshop in conjunction with CARS’19 in Rennes, France. ->http://workshop2019.surgical-data-science.org/ and the Joint 14th AE-CAI, 7th CARE and 3rd OR 2.0 workshop in conjunction with MICCAI'20 in Lima, Peru (virtual).
The joint 15th AE-CAI, 8th CARE and 4th OR 2.0 workshop will take place in Strasbourg, France in 2021! -> https://workshops.ap-lab.ca/aecai2021/

Currently, I am a board member of Women in MICCAI, and formerly was a member of the Student Board and the Educational Initiative at MICCAI.
