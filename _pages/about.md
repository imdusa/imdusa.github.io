My research interests span defining the technologies of future, artificial intelligence powered, healthcare applications. More specifically, I work on surgical vision and perception, and medical image computing. My background is in computer vision. Lately, I have expanded my research interests in surgical data science and context-awareness in operating theaters.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor (UK: Lecturer) at University of Leeds, School of Computing. I received my MS and PhD from State University of New York at Buffalo under supervision of Prof. Jason J. Corso, and my BS from TOBB University of Economics and Technology. I am a FULBRIGHT alumna. I was formerly an Assistant Professor at Gazi University, Computer Engineering department, a Post-doctoral Researcher at MediCIS, INSERM, Universite de Rennes 1 working on Connected Optimized Network & Data in Operating Rooms Project with multiple academic and industrial partners, funded by BPI France, a Project Coordinator / Researcher at ATLAS Program, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center working in close collaboration with clinicians on Deep Blue Project, funded by the Roswell Alliance Foundation, and a Research Assistant at Vision and Perceptual Machines Lab at State University of New York at Buffalo on a National Institutes of Health (NIH) project in collaboration with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.

I organized the First and Second International Workshops on Context-Aware Operating Theaters in conjunction with MICCAI, co-organized the second International Surgical Data Science Workshop in conjunction with CARS, and a series of the Joint AE-CAI, CARE and OR 2.0 Workshops in conjunction with MICCAI.

I served as a board member of Women in MICCAI, and formerly was a member of the Student Board and the Educational Initiative at MICCAI.
